                   <p>The E-Cig – short for Electronic Cigarette – is a device that is battery powered to produce inhaled doses of nicotine by way of a vaporized solution. It makes use of a rechargeable battery that powers a heating element (coil). The E-Liquid (more on E-Liquid below) comes in contact with the coil and is then vaporized.

                   <p>An Electronic Cigarette is quite simple is design, but there are multiple parts that can make up or be used with the electronic cigarette. Below is the basic parts that make up a complete electronic cigarette. Some can be replaced with other style parts.

    Tube (or Box): The tube is the housing to the e-cig (electronic cigarette). Some tubes come in a variety of shapes and sizes to accommodate certain battery sizes and internal electronics. The tube part of the device is typically the bottom part of the electronic cigarette.

    Battery: The battery comes in many shapes, but the typical battery is similar to an AA battery styling and varies in specific sizes. (See Battery Breakdown)

    Power Button (Manual or Automatic): The power button is what activates the battery, which then delivers power to the heating element (atomizer or cartomizer). Some buttons have multiple use functions. The button is considered as a ‘manual’ e-cig. An ‘automatic’ e-cig has no button and is activated by a sensor that detects when you’re pulling vapor from the device. Many e-cigarette users (or vapers) tend to like a manual e-cig more because an automatic e-cig can be triggered to activate at times when not in use, which depletes the battery life.

    Connector: The connector is a part that sits at the top of the electronic cigarette and is used to accept the atomizer (or cartomizer). The connector has female (or male) threading. The connector will range in various styles such as 510 (the most common), 801 and 901 just to name a few.

    Atomizer (or Cartomizer): The atomizer is a small metal tubed casing that has a male (or female) threading at the bottom to be attached to an electronic cigarette. The top of the atomizer is an opening to allow the use of e-liquid. To fill an atomizer, the user will typically drip 2 to 3 drops onto of the coil (which sits inside and on the bottom of the metal atomizer tubing). The cartomizer is much like the atomizer, except that the metal tubing is a bit longer. Inside the metal tubing of a cartomizer is a filler material. This filler material acts as a wicking system. To fill a cartomizer with e-liquid, the user will pour e-liquid onto the filler material until it has a full or soggy look. A cartomizer is also used inside of tank systems.

    Tank System: The tank system is designed to hold more e-liquid than the typical cartomizer. The tank is a tube that is usually made from a plastic material. At the top and bottom of the plastic tube tank is end caps. The end caps usually have rubber gromets as a sealer between the caps and the plastic tubing. In the middle of the caps is a hole cut out to accept the cartomizer. Some tank systems makes use of its own wicking system instead of a cartomizer.

    Drip Tip: A drip tip is the mouth piece that will sit on top of the atomizer or cartomizer. The metal tube casing on an atomizer or cartomizer can sometimes become hot to the touch, so a drip tip is used so your lip do not come in contact with the atomizer or cartomizer casing. A drip tip was also designed so that you could easily drip e-liquid into your atomizer without taking off the mouth piece. This is done by pouring your drops of e-liquid into the center hole of the drip tip.

   <h2 class="entry-title">E liquid</h2>
                  
                    
                   <p>E-liquid (or eJuice) is the liquid that is used to vaporize. E-Liquid typically contains Vegetable Glycerin, Propylene Glycol, Nicotine and Flavoring. The user can generally custom order e-liquid by requesting a certain VG (Vegetable Glycerin) percentage and PG (Propylene Glycol) percentage.  However, as the industry has progressed, many e-liquid manufacturers are distributing e-liquid with a set VG/PG percentage.



                   <div class="img-post right"><a href="http://snakeyevape.com/Juice_c6.htm" class="prettyphoto post-featured-img"><img src="../placeholders/portfolio/photo/7.jpg"></a> <span>E liquid</span></div> The user can also request a certain nicotine strength. Nicotine isn’t required to be in e-liquid in order to vaporize it. There are some users who in fact do not use nicotine. These type of ‘vapers’ are called “No-Nic” vapers. The common nicotine strengths are from 0mg to 24mg. It is said to be safer to not exceed 24mg of nicotine and most electronic cigarette vendors will not offer more than that amount either. The most common nicotine strength used is 18mg on the high side and 12mg on the low side.

As new products continue to emerge, more advanced electronic cigarettes have enabled vapers to drop their nicotine strengths since these advance devices deliver nicotine more efficiently.  In fact, there’s a study that has been published proving that advanced devices deliver nicotine greater than cig-a-likes (an e-cig that looks very similar to a real tobacco cigarette).

    Using electronic cigarettes and understanding how to vape is pretty simple. Although it requires more action than the traditional tobacco cigarette, it is far less harmful. Once you grasp what it takes to use an electronic cigarette (which consists of a charged battery and a cartomizer/atomizer/tank filled with e-liquid), here’s some useful tips on how to vape.


    
    For your first time inhaling vapor, it’s a lot different to your lungs and it doesn’t recognize it. Your lungs are used to tobacco smoke, which is completely different than vapor. With a traditional cigarette, you pull hard to get smoke, but with vaping – you’ll pull slow and steady. Remember, liquid is inside your atomizer/cartomizer, so you don’t want to pull hard enough to suck that liquid into your mouth.

    When you inhale vapor, the longer you hold it in your mouth, the less vapor you’ll blow out.

    Remember, this is about you… so find your own style of vaping and what feels most comfortable to you.
